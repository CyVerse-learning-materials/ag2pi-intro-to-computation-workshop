Introducing the Shell
=====================

----

**Questions:**

- What is a command shell and why would I use one?

----

**Objectives:**

* Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.
* Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.

----

**Keypoints:**
* Explain the steps in the shell's read-run-print cycle.
* Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a ``-``.
* Identify the actual command, options, and filenames in a command-line call.
* Demonstrate the use of tab completion and explain its advantages.
* A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
* The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for
  automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
* The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how
  cryptic its commands and operation can be.

----

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

Humans and computers commonly interact in many different ways, such as through a keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems. The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a **graphical user interface** (GUI).
With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.

While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.
Imagine the following task:
for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file.
Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell.
The Unix shell is both a **command-line interface** (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast.
With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want.
Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.

----

**The Shell:**

The shell is a program where users can type commands.
With the shell, it's possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn.
While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you're studying.
However, unlike a spoken language, a small number of "words" (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful
pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of
commands can be written into a *script*\ , improving the reproducibility of
workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.
Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems.
As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,
being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.
We can build on the command-line skills covered here
to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opening The Shell Via CyVerse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

##Add content here for opening the shell on CyVerse##

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**\ ,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

.. code-block::

   $

The shell typically uses ``$`` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as ``$``.
Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
*do not type the prompt*\ , only the commands that follow it.

So let's try our first command, ``ls`` which is short for listing.
This command will list the contents of the current directory:

.. code-block::

   $ ls

.. code-block::

   Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
   Documents   Library     Music       Public

Command not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
will print an error message such as:

.. code-block::

   $ ks

.. code-block::

   ks: command not found

 This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command is not installed.

----

Navigating Files and Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

----

**Questions:**

* How can I move around on my computer?
* How can I see what files and directories I have?
* How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?

----

**Objectives:**

* Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.
* Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.
* Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.
* Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command
* Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.

**Keypoints:**

* The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
* Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
* Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
* \ ``cd [path]`` changes the current working directory.
* \ ``ls [path]`` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ``ls`` on its own lists the current working directory.
* \ ``pwd`` prints the user's current working directory.
* \ ``/`` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
* A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
* An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
* Directory names in a path are separated with ``/`` on Unix, but ``\\`` on Windows.
* \ ``..`` means 'the directory above the current one'; ``.`` on its own means 'the current directory'.

----

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**. It organizes our data into files,Â which hold information, and directories (also called 'folders'), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.

First let's find out where we are by running a command called ``pwd``
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like *places* - at any time
while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called
our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. 'here', so knowing where you are before running
a command is important. ``pwd`` shows you where you are:

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/JupyterLab/

 Here,
 the computer's response is ``/Users/JupyterLab``\ ,
 which is the application's **home directory**\ :

Home Directory Variation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.
On Linux it may look like ``/home/nelle``\ ,
and on Windows it will be similar to ``C:\Documents and Settings\nelle`` or
``C:\Users\nelle``.
(Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)
In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows
output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.

To understand what a 'home directory' is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of this example, we'll be illustrating the filesystem inside our CyVerse app.
After this illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.

On the CyVerse app, the filesystem looks like this:


.. image:: ../img/filesystem.svg
   :target: ../img/filesystem.svg
   :alt: The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories
 titled bin, data, users, and tmp


 At the top is the **root directory**
 that holds everything else.
 We refer to it using a slash character, ``/``\ , on its own;
 this is the leading slash in ``/Users/JupyterLab``.

 Inside that directory are several other directories:
 ``bin`` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
 ``data`` (for miscellaneous data files),
 ``Users`` (where users' personal directories are located),
 ``tmp`` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
 and so on.

 We know that our current working directory ``/Users/JupyterLab`` is stored inside ``/Users``
 because ``/Users`` is the first part of its name.
 Similarly,
 we know that ``/Users`` is stored inside the root directory ``/``
 because its name begins with ``/``.

Slashes
~~~~~~~

 Notice that there are two meanings for the ``/`` character.
 When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
 it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a path,
 it's just a separator.

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running ``ls``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ ls

.. code-block::

    Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
    Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures

 (Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating
 system and how you have customized your filesystem.)

 ``ls`` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory.
 We can make its output more comprehensible by using the ``-F`` **option**
 (also known as a **switch** or a **flag**\ ) ,
 which tells ``ls`` to classify the output
 by adding a marker to file and directory names to indicate what they are:


* a trailing ``/`` indicates that this is a directory
* ``@`` indicates a link
*
  ``*`` indicates an executable

  Depending on your default options,
  the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or
  directory.

  .. code-block::

     $ ls -F

  .. code-block::

     Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
     Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/

Clearing your terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using the
 ``clear`` command. You can still access previous commands using :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>â</kbd>`
 and :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ â</kbdto move line-by-line, or by scrolling in your terminal.

 Here,
 we can see that our home directory contains only **sub-directories**.
 Any names in your output that don't have a classification symbol,
 are plain old **files**.

General syntax of a shell command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
 which we will dissect into its component parts:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F /

 ``ls`` is the **command**\ , with an **option** ``-F`` and an
 **argument** ``/``.
 We've already encountered options (also called **switches** or **flags**\ ) which
 either start with a single dash (\ ``-``\ ) or two dashes (\ ``--``\ ), and they change the behavior of a command.
 Arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
 Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as **parameters**.
 A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument: but a
 command doesn't always require an argument or an option.

 Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
 between ``ls`` and ``-F`` the shell will look for a command called ``ls-F``\ , which
 doesn't exist. Also, capitalization can be important. For example, ``ls -s`` will display the size of files and directories alongside the names, while ``ls -S`` will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -s Desktop/data-shell/data
    total 116
     4 amino-acids.txt   4 animals.txt   4 morse.txt  12 planets.txt  76 sunspot.txt
     4 animal-counts     4 elements      4 pdb         4 salmon.txt
    $ ls -S Desktop/data-shell/data
    sunspot.txt  animal-counts  pdb        amino-acids.txt  salmon.txt
    planets.txt  elements       morse.txt  animals.txt

 Putting all that together, our command above gives us a listing
 of files and directories in the root directory ``/``.
 An example of the output you might get from the above command is given below:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F /

.. code-block::

    Applications/         System/
    Library/              Users/
    Network/              Volumes/

Getting help
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 ``ls`` has lots of other **options**. There are two common ways to find out how
 to use a command and what options it accepts:


#. We can pass a ``--help`` option to the command, such as:
   .. code-block::

       $ ls --help


#. We can read its manual with ``man``\ , such as:
   .. code-block::

       $ man ls

 **Depending on your environment you might find that only one of these works
 (either ``man`` or ``--help``\ , eg. ``man`` works for macOS and ``--help`` typically works for Git Bash).**

 We'll describe both ways below.

The ``--help`` option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be
 run from within bash, support a ``--help`` option to display more
 information on how to use the command or program.

.. code-block::

    $ ls --help

.. code-block::

    Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
    Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

    Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
      -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
      -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
          --author               with -l, print the author of each file
      -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
          --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                                   '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                                   1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
      -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
      -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                                   modification of file status information);
                                   with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                                   otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
      -C                         list entries by columns
          --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                                   if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
      -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
      -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
      -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
      -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
          --file-type            likewise, except do not append '*'
          --format=WORD          across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l,
                                   single-column -1, verbose -l, vertical -C
          --full-time            like -l --time-style=full-iso
      -g                         like -l, but do not list owner
          --group-directories-first
                                 group directories before files;
                                   can be augmented with a --sort option, but any
                                   use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping
      -G, --no-group             in a long listing, don't print group names
      -h, --human-readable       with -l and/or -s, print human readable sizes
                                   (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
          --si                   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024
      -H, --dereference-command-line
                                 follow symbolic links listed on the command line
          --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir
                                 follow each command line symbolic link
                                   that points to a directory
          --hide=PATTERN         do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN
                                   (overridden by -a or -A)
          --indicator-style=WORD  append indicator with style WORD to entry names:
                                   none (default), slash (-p),
                                   file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)
      -i, --inode                print the index number of each file
      -I, --ignore=PATTERN       do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN

      -l                         use a long listing format
      -L, --dereference          when showing file information for a symbolic
                                   link, show information for the file the link
                                   references rather than for the link itself
      -m                         fill width with a comma separated list of entries
      -n, --numeric-uid-gid      like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs
      -N, --literal              print raw entry names (don't treat e.g. control
                                   characters specially)
      -o                         like -l, but do not list group information
      -p, --indicator-style=slash
                                 append / indicator to directories
      -q, --hide-control-chars   print ? instead of nongraphic characters
          --show-control-chars   show nongraphic characters as-is (the default,
                                   unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)
      -Q, --quote-name           enclose entry names in double quotes
          --quoting-style=WORD   use quoting style WORD for entry names:
                                   literal, locale, shell, shell-always,
                                   shell-escape, shell-escape-always, c, escape

          --sort=WORD            sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S),
                                   time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)
          --time=WORD            with -l, show time as WORD instead of default
                                   modification time: atime or access or use (-u);

                                   as sort key if --sort=time (newest first)
          --time-style=STYLE     with -l, show times using style STYLE:
                                   full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT;
                                   FORMAT is interpreted like in 'date'; if FORMAT
                                   is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies
                                   to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files;
                                   if STYLE is prefixed with 'posix-', STYLE
                                   takes effect only outside the POSIX locale
      -t                         sort by modification time, newest first

                                   with -l: show access time and sort by name;
                                   otherwise: sort by access time, newest first
      -U                         do not sort; list entries in directory order
      -v                         natural sort of (version) numbers within text
      -w, --width=COLS           set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit
      -x                         list entries by lines instead of by columns
      -X                         sort alphabetically by entry extension
      -Z, --context              print any security context of each file
      -1                         list one file per line.  Avoid '\n' with -q or -b
          --help     display this help and exit
          --version  output version information and exit

    The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
    Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

    Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
    with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
    standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
    variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

    Exit status:
     0  if OK,
     1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
     2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

Unsupported command-line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you try to use an option (flag) that is not supported, ``ls`` and other commands
 will usually print an error message similar to:

.. code-block::

   $ ls -j

.. code-block::

    ls: invalid option -- 'j'
    Try 'ls --help' for more information.

The ``man`` command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``man`` is short for manual, which will open the unix manual in your terminal window.

 So, the other way to learn about ``ls`` is to type

.. code-block::

    $ man ls

 This will turn your terminal into a page with a description
 of the ``ls`` command and its options.

 To navigate through the ``man`` pages,
 you may use :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>â</kbdand <kbd>â</kbdto move line-by-line,
 or try <kbd>B</kbdand <kbd>Spacebar</kbdto skip up and down by a full page.
 To search for a character or word in the `man` pages,
 use <kbd>/</kbdfollowed by the character or word you are searching for.
 Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits.  If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd(for moving forward) and <kbd>Shift</kbd>`\ +\ :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ N</kbd(for moving backward).

 To **quit** the ``man`` pages, press :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>Q</kbd>`.

Manual pages on the web
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Of course there is a third way to access help for commands:
 searching the internet via your web browser.
 When using internet search, including the phrase ``unix man page`` in your search
 query will help to find relevant results.

 GNU provides links to its
 `manuals <http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html>`_ including the
 `core GNU utilities <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html>`_\ ,
 which covers many commands introduced within this lesson.

Exploring More ``ls`` Flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command ``ls`` do when used
 with the ``-l`` option? What about if you use both the ``-l`` and the ``-h`` option?

 Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such
 as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful
 nevertheless.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The ``-l`` option makes ``ls`` use a **l**\ ong listing format, showing not only
 the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
 and the time of its last modification. If you use both the ``-h`` option and the ``-l`` option,
 this makes the file size '\ **h**\ uman readable', i.e. displaying something like ``5.3K``
 instead of ``5369``.

Listing in Reverse Chronological Order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 By default ``ls`` lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical
 order by name. The command ``ls -t`` lists items by time of last
 change instead of alphabetically. The command ``ls -r`` lists the
 contents of a directory in reverse order.
 Which file is displayed last when you combine the ``-t`` and ``-r`` flags?
 Hint: You may need to use the ``-l`` flag to see the
 last changed dates.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The most recently changed file is listed last when using ``-rt``. This
 can be very useful for finding your most recent edits or checking to
 see if a new output file was written.

Exploring Other Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Not only can we use ``ls`` on the current working directory, but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a
 look at our ``Desktop`` directory by running ``ls -F Desktop``\ ,
 i.e.,
 the command ``ls`` with the ``-F`` **option** and the **argument**  ``Desktop``.
 The argument ``Desktop`` tells ``ls`` that
 we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F Desktop

.. code-block::

    data-shell/

 Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your
 Desktop directory, including the ``data-shell`` directory you downloaded at
 the `setup for this lesson <{{ page.root }}{% link setup.md %}>`_.
 On many systems,
 the command line Desktop directory is the same as your GUI Desktop.
 Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that your output is accurate.

 As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
 your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.
 Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
 it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
 just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
 but it's a self-defeating strategy.

 Now that we know the ``data-shell`` directory is located in our Desktop directory, we
 can do two things.

 First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
 a directory name to ``ls``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F Desktop/data-shell

.. code-block::

    creatures/          molecules/          notes.txt           solar.pdf
    data/               north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg           writing/

 Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so
 we are no longer located in
 our home directory.

 The command to change locations is ``cd`` followed by a
 directory name to change our working directory.
 ``cd`` stands for 'change directory',
 which is a bit misleading:
 the command doesn't change the directory,
 it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
 The ``cd`` command is akin to double clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.

 Let's say we want to move to the ``data`` directory we saw above.  We can
 use the following series of commands to get there:

.. code-block::

    $ cd Desktop
    $ cd data-shell
    $ cd data

 These commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop directory, then into
 the ``data-shell`` directory, then into the ``data`` directory.  You will notice that ``cd`` doesn't print anything.  This is normal.  Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed.  But if we run ``pwd`` after it, we can see that we are now
 in ``/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data``.
 If we run ``ls -F`` without arguments now,
 it lists the contents of ``/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data``\ ,
 because that's where we now are:

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F

.. code-block::

    amino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/           salmon.txt
    animals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt

 We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory)
 but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)?
 We might try the following:

.. code-block::

    $ cd data-shell

.. code-block::

    -bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory

 But we get an error!  Why is this?

 With our methods so far,
 ``cd`` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory.  There are
 different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start
 with the simplest.

 There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level
 that looks like this:

.. code-block::

    $ cd ..

 ``..`` is a special directory name meaning
 "the directory containing this one",
 or more succinctly,
 the **parent** of the current directory.
 Sure enough,
 if we run ``pwd`` after running ``cd ..``\ , we're back in ``/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell

 The special directory ``..`` doesn't usually show up when we run ``ls``.  If we want
 to display it, we can add the ``-a`` option to ``ls -F``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F -a

.. code-block::

    ./   .bash_profile  data/       north-pacific-gyre/  pizza.cfg  thesis/
    ../  creatures/     molecules/  notes.txt            solar.pdf  writing/

 ``-a`` stands for 'show all';
 it forces ``ls`` to show us file and directory names that begin with ``.``\ ,
 such as ``..`` (which, if we're in ``/Users/nelle``\ , refers to the ``/Users`` directory)
 As you can see,
 it also displays another special directory that's just called ``.``\ ,
 which means 'the current working directory'.
 It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
 but we'll see some uses for it soon.

 Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined
 with a single ``-`` and no spaces between the options: ``ls -F -a`` is
 equivalent to ``ls -Fa``.

Other Hidden Files
==================

 In addition to the hidden directories ``..`` and ``.``\ , you may also see a file
 called ``.bash_profile``. This file usually contains shell configuration
 settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning
 with ``.``. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure
 different programs on your computer. The prefix ``.`` is used to prevent these
 configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard ``ls`` command
 is used.

Orthogonality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The special names ``.`` and ``..`` don't belong to ``cd``\ ;
 they are interpreted the same way by every program.
 For example,
 if we are in ``/Users/nelle/data``\ ,
 the command ``ls ..`` will give us a listing of ``/Users/nelle``.
 When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined,
 programmers say they are **orthogonal**\ :
 Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
 because there are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.

 These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
 ``pwd``\ , ``ls`` and ``cd``.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens
 if you type ``cd`` on its own, without giving
 a directory?

.. code-block::

    $ cd

 How can you check what happened?  ``pwd`` gives us the answer!

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/nelle

 It turns out that ``cd`` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
 which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.

 Let's try returning to the ``data`` directory from before.  Last time, we used
 three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
 to move to ``data`` in one step:

.. code-block::

    $ cd Desktop/data-shell/data

 Check that we've moved to the right place by running ``pwd`` and ``ls -F``

 If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use ``cd ..``.  But
 there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
 current location.

 So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
 we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command
 like ``ls`` or ``cd``\ , it tries to find that location  from where we are,
 rather than from the root of the file system.

 However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by
 including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
 leading slash.  The leading ``/`` tells the computer to follow the path from
 the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
 no matter where we are when we run the command.

 This allows us to move to our ``data-shell`` directory from anywhere on
 the filesystem (including from inside ``data``\ ).  To find the absolute path
 we're looking for, we can use ``pwd`` and then extract the piece we need
 to move to ``data-shell``.

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data

.. code-block::

    $ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell

 Run ``pwd`` and ``ls -F`` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

Two More Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The shell interprets the character ``~`` (tilde) at the start of a path to
 mean "the current user's home directory". For example, if Nelle's home
 directory is ``/Users/nelle``\ , then ``~/data`` is equivalent to
 ``/Users/nelle/data``. This only works if it is the first character in the
 path: ``here/there/~/elsewhere`` is *not* ``here/there/Users/nelle/elsewhere``.

 Another shortcut is the ``-`` (dash) character.  ``cd`` will translate ``-`` into
 *the previous directory I was in*\ , which is faster than having to remember,
 then type, the full path.  This is a *very* efficient way of moving back
 and forth between directories. The difference between ``cd ..`` and ``cd -`` is
 that the former brings you *up*\ , while the latter brings you *back*. You can
 think of it as the *Last Channel* button on a TV remote.

Absolute vs Relative Paths
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Starting from ``/Users/amanda/data``\ ,
 which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory,
 which is ``/Users/amanda``\ ?


#. ``cd .``
#. ``cd /``
#. ``cd /home/amanda``
#. ``cd ../..``
#. ``cd ~``
#. ``cd home``
#. ``cd ~/data/..``
#. ``cd``
#. ``cd ..``

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#. No: ``.`` stands for the current directory.
#. No: ``/`` stands for the root directory.
#. No: Amanda's home directory is ``/Users/amanda``.
#. No: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in ``/Users``.
#. Yes: ``~`` stands for the user's home directory, in this case ``/Users/amanda``.
#. No: this would navigate into a directory ``home`` in the current directory if it exists.
#. Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.
#. Yes: shortcut to go back to the user's home directory.
#. Yes: goes up one level.

Relative Path Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Using the filesystem diagram below, if ``pwd`` displays ``/Users/thing``\ ,
 what will ``ls -F ../backup`` display?


#. ``../backup: No such file or directory``
#. ``2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27``
#. ``2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/``
#.
   ``original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/``


   .. image:: ../img/filesystem-challenge.svg
      :target: ../img/filesystem-challenge.svg
      :alt: File System for Challenge Questions


Solution
~~~~~~~~


#. No: there *is* a directory ``backup`` in ``/Users``.
#. No: this is the content of ``Users/thing/backup``\ ,
   but with ``..`` we asked for one level further up.
#. No: see previous explanation.
#. Yes: ``../backup/`` refers to ``/Users/backup/``.

``ls`` Reading Comprehension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Using the filesystem diagram below,
 if ``pwd`` displays ``/Users/backup``\ ,
 and ``-r`` tells ``ls`` to display things in reverse order,
 what command(s) will result in the following output:

.. code-block::

    pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/


.. image:: ../img/filesystem-challenge.svg
   :target: ../img/filesystem-challenge.svg
   :alt: File System for Challenge Questions



#. ``ls pwd``
#. ``ls -r -F``
#. ``ls -r -F /Users/backup``

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#. No: ``pwd`` is not the name of a directory.
#. Yes: ``ls`` without directory argument lists files and directories
   in the current directory.
#. Yes: uses the absolute path explicitly.

Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Knowing this much about files and directories,
 Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
 First,
 she creates a directory called ``north-pacific-gyre``
 (to remind herself where the data came from).
 Inside that,
 she creates a directory called ``2012-07-03``\ ,
 which is the date she started processing the samples.
 She used to use names like ``conference-paper`` and ``revised-results``\ ,
 but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
 (The final straw was when she found herself creating
 a directory called ``revised-revised-results-3``.)

Sorting Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Nelle names her directories 'year-month-day',
 with leading zeroes for months and days,
 because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
 If she used month names,
 December would come before July;
 if she didn't use leading zeroes,
 November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
 means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.

 Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
 with a unique ten-character ID,
 such as 'NENE01729A'.
 This is what she used in her collection log
 to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
 so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
 Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
 she will call her files ``NENE01729A.txt``\ , ``NENE01812A.txt``\ , and so on.
 All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

 Now in her current directory ``data-shell``\ ,
 Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

.. code-block::

    $ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/

 This is a lot to type,
 but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.
 If she types:

.. code-block::

    $ ls nor

 and then presses :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Tab</kbd(the tab key on her keyboard),
 the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

.. code-block::

    $ ls north-pacific-gyre/

 If she presses :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Tab</kbdagain,
 Bash will add ``2012-07-03/`` to the command,
 since it's the only possible completion.
 Pressing :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Tab</kbdagain does nothing,
 since there are 19 possibilities;
 pressing :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Tab</kbdtwice brings up a list of all the files,
 and so on.
 This is called **tab completion**\ ,
 and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

Working With Files and Directories
==================================

**Questions:**

* How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?
* How can I edit files?

**Objectives:**

* Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram.
* Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files.
* Delete, copy and move specified files and/or directories.

**Keypoints:**

* \ ``cp [old] [new]`` copies a file.
* \ ``mkdir [path]`` creates a new directory.
* \ ``mv [old] [new]`` moves (renames) a file or directory.
* \ ``rm [path]`` removes (deletes) a file.
* \ ``*`` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so ``*.txt`` matches all files ending in ``.txt``.
* \ ``?`` matches any single character in a filename, so ``?.txt`` matches ``a.txt`` but not ``any.txt``.
* Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including ``Ctrl-X``\ , ``Control-X``\ , and ``^X``.
* The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
* Most files' names are ``something.extension``. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
* Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.

----

Creating Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 We now know how to explore files and directories,
 but how do we create them in the first place?

Step one: see where we are and what we already have
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Let's go back to our ``data-shell`` directory on the Desktop
 and use ``ls -F`` to see what it contains:

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F

.. code-block::

    creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/

Create a directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Let's create a new directory called ``thesis`` using the command ``mkdir thesis``
 (which has no output):

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir thesis

 As you might guess from its name,
 ``mkdir`` means 'make directory'.
 Since ``thesis`` is a relative path
 (i.e., does not have a leading slash, like ``/what/ever/thesis``\ ),
 the new directory is created in the current working directory:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F

.. code-block::

    creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  thesis/  writing/

 Since we've just created the ``thesis`` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F thesis

 Note that ``mkdir`` is not limited to creating single directories one at a time. The ``-p`` option allows ``mkdir`` to create a directory with any number of nested subdirectories in a single operation:

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir -p thesis/chapter_1/section_1/subsection_1

 The ``-R`` option to the ``ls`` command will list all nested subdirectories wtihin a directory.  Let's use ``ls -FR`` to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created beneath the ``thesis`` directory:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -FR thesis
    chapter_1/

    thesis/chapter_1:
    section_1/

    thesis/chapter_1/section_1:
    subsection_1/

    thesis/chapter_1/section_1/subsection_1:

Two ways of doing the same thing
--------------------------------

 Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer.
 If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer,
 the ``thesis`` directory will appear there too.
 While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files,
 the files and directories themselves are the same.

Good names for files and directories
------------------------------------

 Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful
 when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful
 tips for the names of your files.


#.
   Don't use spaces.

   Spaces can make a name more meaningful,
   but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line
   it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories.
   You can use ``-`` or ``_`` instead (e.g. ``north-pacific-gyre/`` rather than ``north pacific gyre/``\ ).

#.
   Don't begin the name with ``-`` (dash).

   Commands treat names starting with ``-`` as options.

#.
   Stick with letters, numbers, ``.`` (period or 'full stop'), ``-`` (dash) and ``_`` (underscore).

   Many other characters have special meanings on the command line.
   We will learn about some of these during this lesson.
   There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as
   expected and can even result in data loss.

   If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces
   or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes (\ ``""``\ ).

Create a text file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Let's change our working directory to ``thesis`` using ``cd``\ ,
 then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called ``draft.txt``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ cd thesis
    $ nano draft.txt

Which Editor?
-------------

 When we say, '\ ``nano`` is a text editor' we really do mean 'text': it can
 only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
 human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the
 least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may
 not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
 after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
 many programmers use `Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_ or
 `Vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_ (both of which require more time to learn),
 or a graphical editor such as
 `Gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`_. On Windows, you may wish to
 use `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_.  Windows also has a built-in
 editor called ``notepad`` that can be run from the command line in the same
 way as ``nano`` for the purposes of this lesson.

 No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
 for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
 use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
 your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
 documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
 another directory the first time you 'Save As...'

 Let's type in a few lines of text.
 Once we're happy with our text, we can press :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>`\ +\ :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>O</kbd>`
 (press the :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Ctrl</kbdor :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Control</kbdkey and, while
 holding it down, press the :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ O</kbdkey) to write our data to disk
 (we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
 press :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Return</kbdto accept the suggested default of ``draft.txt``\ ).


.. raw:: html

   <div style="width:80%; margin: auto;"><img alt="Nano in Action" src="../img/nano-screenshot.png"></div>


 Once our file is saved, we can use :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>`\ +\ :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ X</kbdto quit the editor and
 return to the shell.

Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key
-----------------------

 The Control key is also called the 'Ctrl' key. There are various ways
 in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
 see an instruction to press the :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Control</kbdkey and, while holding it down,
 press the :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ X</kbdkey, described as any of:


* ``Control-X``
* ``Control+X``
* ``Ctrl-X``
* ``Ctrl+X``
* ``^X``
*
  ``C-x``

  In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see ``^G Get Help ^O WriteOut``.
  This means that you can use ``Control-G`` to get help and ``Control-O`` to save your
  file.

 ``nano`` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
 but ``ls`` now shows that we have created a file called ``draft.txt``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ ls

.. code-block::

    draft.txt

Creating Files a Different Way
------------------------------

 We have seen how to create text files using the ``nano`` editor.
 Now, try the following command:

.. code-block::

    $ touch my_file.txt


#.
   What did the ``touch`` command do?
   When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer,
   does the file show up?

#.
   Use ``ls -l`` to inspect the files.  How large is ``my_file.txt``\ ?

#.
   When might you want to create a file this way?

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#.
   The ``touch`` command generates a new file called ``my_file.txt`` in
   your current directory.  You
   can observe this newly generated file by typing ``ls`` at the
   command line prompt.  ``my_file.txt`` can also be viewed in your
   GUI file explorer.

#.
   When you inspect the file with ``ls -l``\ , note that the size of
   ``my_file.txt`` is 0 bytes.  In other words, it contains no data.
   If you open ``my_file.txt`` using your text editor it is blank.

#.
   Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but
   instead require that empty files have already been generated.
   When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to
   populate with its output.  The touch command allows you to
   efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such
   programs.

What's In A Name?
-----------------

 You may have noticed that all of Nelle's files are named 'something dot
 something', and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension
 ``.txt``.  This is just a convention: we can call a file ``mythesis`` or
 almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names
 most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds
 of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the
 **filename extension**\ , and indicates
 what type of data the file holds: ``.txt`` signals a plain text file, ``.pdf``
 indicates a PDF document, ``.cfg`` is a configuration file full of parameters
 for some program or other, ``.png`` is a PNG image, and so on.

 This is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files contain
 bytes: it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes
 according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration
 files, images, and so on.

 Naming a PNG image of a whale as ``whale.mp3`` doesn't somehow
 magically turn it into a recording of whalesong, though it *might*
 cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player
 when someone double-clicks it.

Moving files and directories
----------------------------

 Returning to the ``data-shell`` directory,

.. code-block::

    cd ~/Desktop/data-shell/

 In our ``thesis`` directory we have a file ``draft.txt``
 which isn't a particularly informative name,
 so let's change the file's name using ``mv``\ ,
 which is short for 'move':

.. code-block::

    $ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt

 The first argument tells ``mv`` what we're 'moving',
 while the second is where it's to go.
 In this case,
 we're moving ``thesis/draft.txt`` to ``thesis/quotes.txt``\ ,
 which has the same effect as renaming the file.
 Sure enough,
 ``ls`` shows us that ``thesis`` now contains one file called ``quotes.txt``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ ls thesis

.. code-block::

    quotes.txt

 One has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since ``mv`` will
 silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
 lead to data loss. An additional option, ``mv -i`` (or ``mv --interactive``\ ),
 can be used to make ``mv`` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.

 Note that ``mv`` also works on directories.

 Let's move ``quotes.txt`` into the current working directory.
 We use ``mv`` once again,
 but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
 to tell ``mv`` that we want to keep the filename,
 but put the file somewhere new.
 (This is why the command is called 'move'.)
 In this case,
 the directory name we use is the special directory name ``.`` that we mentioned earlier.

.. code-block::

    $ mv thesis/quotes.txt .

 The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
 ``ls`` now shows us that ``thesis`` is empty:

.. code-block::

    $ ls thesis

 Further,
 ``ls`` with a filename or directory name as an argument only lists that file or directory.
 We can use this to see that ``quotes.txt`` is still in our current directory:

.. code-block::

    $ ls quotes.txt

.. code-block::

    quotes.txt

Moving Files to a new folder
----------------------------

 After running the following commands,
 Jamie realizes that she put the files ``sucrose.dat`` and ``maltose.dat`` into the wrong folder.
 The files should have been placed in the ``raw`` folder.

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F
     analyzed/ raw/
    $ ls -F analyzed
    fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
    $ cd analyzed

 Fill in the blanks to move these files to the ``raw/`` folder
 (i.e. the one she forgot to put them in)

.. code-block::

    $ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ____/____

Solution
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    $ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw

 Recall that ``..`` refers to the parent directory (i.e. one above the current directory)
 and that ``.`` refers to the current directory.

Copying files and directories
-----------------------------

 The ``cp`` command works very much like ``mv``\ ,
 except it copies a file instead of moving it.
 We can check that it did the right thing using ``ls``
 with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,
 ``ls`` can be given multiple paths at once:

.. code-block::

    $ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
    $ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

.. code-block::

    quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt

 We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
 `recursive <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion>`_ option ``-r``\ ,
 e.g. to back up a directory:

.. code-block::

    $ cp -r thesis thesis_backup

 We can check the result by listing the contents of both the ``thesis`` and ``thesis_backup`` directory:

.. code-block::

    $ ls thesis thesis_backup

.. code-block::

    thesis:
    quotations.txt

    thesis_backup:
    quotations.txt

Renaming Files
--------------

 Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the
 statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: ``statstics.txt``

 After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
 correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?


#. ``cp statstics.txt statistics.txt``
#. ``mv statstics.txt statistics.txt``
#. ``mv statstics.txt .``
#. ``cp statstics.txt .``

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#. No.  While this would create a file with the correct name, the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory
   and would need to be deleted.
#. Yes, this would work to rename the file.
#. No, the period(.) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names
   cannot be created.
#. No, the period(.) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names
   cannot be created.

Moving and Copying
------------------

 What is the output of the closing ``ls`` command in the sequence shown below?

.. code-block::

    $ pwd

.. code-block::

    /Users/jamie/data

.. code-block::

    $ ls

.. code-block::

    proteins.dat

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir recombined
    $ mv proteins.dat recombined/
    $ cp recombined/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
    $ ls


#. ``proteins-saved.dat recombined``
#. ``recombined``
#. ``proteins.dat recombined``
#. ``proteins-saved.dat``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 We start in the ``/Users/jamie/data`` directory, and create a new folder called ``recombined``.
 The second line moves (\ ``mv``\ ) the file ``proteins.dat`` to the new folder (\ ``recombined``\ ).
 The third line makes a copy of the file we just moved.  The tricky part here is where the file was
 copied to.  Recall that ``..`` means 'go up a level', so the copied file is now in ``/Users/jamie``.
 Notice that ``..`` is interpreted with respect to the current working
 directory, **not** with respect to the location of the file being copied.
 So, the only thing that will show using ls (in ``/Users/jamie/data``\ ) is the recombined folder.


#. No, see explanation above.  ``proteins-saved.dat`` is located at ``/Users/jamie``
#. Yes
#. No, see explanation above.  ``proteins.dat`` is located at ``/Users/jamie/data/recombined``
#. No, see explanation above.  ``proteins-saved.dat`` is located at ``/Users/jamie``

Removing files and directories
------------------------------

 Returning to the ``data-shell`` directory,
 let's tidy up this directory by removing the ``quotes.txt`` file we created.
 The Unix command we'll use for this is ``rm`` (short for 'remove'):

.. code-block::

    $ rm quotes.txt

 We can confirm the file has gone using ``ls``\ :

.. code-block::

    $ ls quotes.txt

.. code-block::

    ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory

Deleting Is Forever
-------------------

 The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted
 files from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,
 when we delete files, they are unlinked from the file system so that
 their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
 recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
 work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
 file's disk space right away.

Using ``rm`` Safely
-----------------------

 What happens when we execute ``rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt``\ ?
 Why would we want this protection when using ``rm``\ ?

Solution
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    $ rm: remove regular file 'thesis_backup/quotations.txt'? y

 The ``-i`` option will prompt before (every) removal (use :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Y</kbdto confirm deletion or :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ N</kbdto keep the file).
 The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.
 By using the ``-i`` option, we have the chance to check that we are deleting only the files that we want to remove.

 If we try to remove the ``thesis`` directory using ``rm thesis``\ ,
 we get an error message:

.. code-block::

    $ rm thesis

.. code-block::

    rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory

 This happens because ``rm`` by default only works on files, not directories.

 ``rm`` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
 recursive option ``-r``\ , and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*\ :

.. code-block::

    $ rm -r thesis

 Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
 ``rm -r`` *should be used with great caution* (you might consider adding the interactive option ``rm -r -i``\ ).

Operations with multiple files and directories
----------------------------------------------

 Oftentimes one needs to copy or move several files at once. This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames, or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards.

Copy with Multiple Filenames
----------------------------

 For this exercise, you can test the commands in the ``data-shell/data`` directory.

 In the example below, what does ``cp`` do when given several filenames and a directory name?

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir backup
    $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/

 In the example below, what does ``cp`` do when given three or more file names?

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F

.. code-block::

    amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt

.. code-block::

    $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 If given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must
 be the last argument), ``cp`` copies the files to the named directory.

 If given three file names, ``cp`` throws an error such as the one below, because it is expecting a directory
 name as the last argument.

.. code-block::

    cp: target âmorse.txtâ is not a directory

Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wildcards
---------

 ``*`` is a **wildcard**\ , which matches zero or more  characters.
 Let's consider the ``data-shell/molecules`` directory:
 ``*.pdb`` matches ``ethane.pdb``\ , ``propane.pdb``\ , and every
 file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, ``p*.pdb`` only matches
 ``pentane.pdb`` and ``propane.pdb``\ , because the 'p' at the front only
 matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.

 ``?`` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
 So ``?ethane.pdb`` would match ``methane.pdb`` whereas
 ``*ethane.pdb`` matches both ``ethane.pdb``\ , and ``methane.pdb``.

 Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
 e.g. ``???ane.pdb`` matches three characters followed by ``ane.pdb``\ ,
 giving ``cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb``.

 When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
 list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
 asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
 any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
 as it is. For example typing ``ls *.pdf`` in the ``molecules`` directory
 (which contains only files with names ending with ``.pdb``\ ) results in
 an error message that there is no file called ``*.pdf``.
 However, generally commands like ``wc`` and ``ls`` see the lists of
 file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
 themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
 expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design.

List filenames matching a pattern
---------------------------------

 When run in the ``molecules`` directory, which ``ls`` command(s) will
 produce this output?

 ``ethane.pdb   methane.pdb``


#. ``ls *t*ane.pdb``
#. ``ls *t?ne.*``
#. ``ls *t??ne.pdb``
#. ``ls ethane.*``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The solution is ``3.``

``1.`` shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (\ ``*``\ ) followed by the letter ``t``\ , then zero or more characters (\ ``*``\ ) followed by ``ane.pdb``. This gives ``ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb``.

``2.`` shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (\ ``*``\ ) followed by the letter ``t``\ , then a single character (\ ``?``\ ), then ``ne.`` followed by zero or more characters (\ ``*``\ ). This will give us ``octane.pdb`` and ``pentane.pdb`` but doesn't match anything which ends in ``thane.pdb``.

``3.`` fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (\ ``??``\ ) between ``t`` and ``ne``. This is the solution.

``4.`` only shows files starting with ``ethane.``.

More on Wildcards
-----------------

 Sam has a directory containing calibration data, datasets, and descriptions of
 the datasets:

.. code-block::

    .

 Before heading off to another field trip, she wants to back up her data and
 send some datasets to her colleague Bob. Sam uses the following commands
 to get the job done:

.. code-block::

    $ cp *dataset* backup/datasets
    $ cp ____calibration____ backup/calibration
    $ cp 2015-____-____ send_to_bob/all_november_files/
    $ cp ____ send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

 Help Sam by filling in the blanks.

 The resulting directory structure should look like this

Solution
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    $ cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
    $ cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
    $ cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

Organizing Directories and Files
--------------------------------

 Jamie is working on a project and she sees that her files aren't very well
 organized:

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F

.. code-block::

    analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat

 The ``fructose.dat`` and ``sucrose.dat`` files contain output from her data
 analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so that the commands below will
 produce the output shown?

.. code-block::

    $ ls -F

.. code-block::

    analyzed/   raw/

.. code-block::

    $ ls analyzed

.. code-block::

    fructose.dat    sucrose.dat

Solution
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    mv *.dat analyzed

 Jamie needs to move her files ``fructose.dat`` and ``sucrose.dat`` to the ``analyzed`` directory.
 The shell will expand *.dat to match all .dat files in the current directory.
 The ``mv`` command then moves the list of .dat files to the 'analyzed' directory.

Reproduce a folder structure
----------------------------

 You're starting a new experiment, and would like to duplicate the directory
 structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

 Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called '2016-05-18',
 which contains a ``data`` folder that in turn contains folders named ``raw`` and
 ``processed`` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
 of the ``2016-05-18-data`` folder into a folder called ``2016-05-20``
 so that your final directory structure looks like this:

.. code-block::

   2016-05-20/
   âââ data
       âââ processed
       âââ raw


 Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?
 What would the other commands do?

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir 2016-05-20
    $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
    $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
    $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir 2016-05-20
    $ cd 2016-05-20
    $ mkdir data
    $ cd data
    $ mkdir raw processed

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
    $ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/raw
    $ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/processed

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir 2016-05-20
    $ cd 2016-05-20
    $ mkdir data
    $ mkdir raw processed

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The first two sets of commands achieve this objective.
 The first set uses relative paths to create the top level directory before
 the subdirectories.

 The third set of commands will give an error because the default behavior of ``mkdir`` won't create a subdirectory
 of a non-existant directory: the intermediate level folders must be created first.

 The fourth set of commands achieve this objective. Remember, the ``-p`` option, followed by a path of one or more
 directories, will cause ``mkdir`` to create any intermediate subdirectories as required.

 The final set of commands generates the 'raw' and 'processed' directories at the same level
 as the 'data' directory.

----

Now that we know a few basic commands,
we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:
the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.
We'll start with the directory called ``data-shell/molecules``
that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.
The ``.pdb`` extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,
a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.

.. code-block::

   $ ls molecules

.. code-block::

   cubane.pdb    ethane.pdb    methane.pdb
   octane.pdb    pentane.pdb   propane.pdb

Let's go into that directory with ``cd`` and run an example  command ``wc cubane.pdb``\ :

.. code-block::

   $ cd molecules
   $ wc cubane.pdb

.. code-block::

   20  156 1158 cubane.pdb

``wc`` is the 'word count' command:
it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files (from left to right, in that order).

If we run the command ``wc *.pdb``\ , the ``*`` in ``*.pdb`` matches zero or more characters,
so the shell turns ``*.pdb`` into a list of all ``.pdb`` files in the current directory:

.. code-block::

   $ wc *.pdb

.. code-block::

     20  156  1158  cubane.pdb
     12  84   622   ethane.pdb
      9  57   422   methane.pdb
     30  246  1828  octane.pdb
     21  165  1226  pentane.pdb
     15  111  825   propane.pdb
    107  819  6081  total

Note that ``wc *.pdb`` also shows the total number of all lines in the last line of the output.

If we run ``wc -l`` instead of just ``wc``\ ,
the output shows only the number of lines per file:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l *.pdb

.. code-block::

     20  cubane.pdb
     12  ethane.pdb
      9  methane.pdb
     30  octane.pdb
     21  pentane.pdb
     15  propane.pdb
    107  total

The ``-m`` and ``-w`` options can also be used with the ``wc`` command, to show
only the number of characters or the number of words in the files.

Why Isn't It Doing Anything?
----------------------------

What happens if a command is supposed to process a file, but we
don't give it a filename? For example, what if we type:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l

but don't type ``*.pdb`` (or anything else) after the command?
Since it doesn't have any filenames, ``wc`` assumes it is supposed to
process input given at the command prompt, so it just sits there and waits for us to give
it some data interactively. From the outside, though, all we see is it
sitting there: the command doesn't appear to do anything.

If you make this kind of mistake, you can escape out of this state by holding down
the control key (\ :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>`\ ) and typing the letter :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>C</kbdonce and letting go of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbdkey.
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>`\ +\ :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>C</kbd>`

Which of these files contains the fewest lines?
It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,
but what if there were 6000?
Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l *.pdb lengths.txt

The greater than symbol, ``>``\ , tells the shell to **redirect** the command's output
to a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:
everything that ``wc`` would have printed has gone into the
file ``lengths.txt`` instead.)  The shell will create
the file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, it will be
silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires
some caution.
``ls lengths.txt`` confirms that the file exists:

.. code-block::

   $ ls lengths.txt

.. code-block::

   lengths.txt

We can now send the content of ``lengths.txt`` to the screen using ``cat lengths.txt``.
The ``cat`` command gets its name from 'concatenate' i.e. join together,
and it prints the contents of files one after another.
There's only one file in this case,
so ``cat`` just shows us what it contains:

.. code-block::

   $ cat lengths.txt

.. code-block::

     20  cubane.pdb
     12  ethane.pdb
      9  methane.pdb
     30  octane.pdb
     21  pentane.pdb
     15  propane.pdb
    107  total

Output Page by Page
-------------------

We'll continue to use ``cat`` in this lesson, for convenience and consistency,
but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen.
More useful in practice is the command ``less``\ ,
which you use with ``less lengths.txt``.
This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops.
You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar,
or back one by pressing ``b``.  Press ``q`` to quit.

Now let's use the ``sort`` command to sort its contents.

What Does ``sort -n`` Do?
-----------------------------

If we run ``sort`` on a file containing the following lines:

.. code-block::

   10
   2
   19
   22
   6

the output is:

.. code-block::

   10
   19
   2
   22
   6

If we run ``sort -n`` on the same input, we get this instead:

.. code-block::

   2
   6
   10
   19
   22

Explain why ``-n`` has this effect.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The ``-n`` option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.

We will also use the ``-n`` option to specify that the sort is
numerical instead of alphanumerical.
This does *not* change the file;
instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:

.. code-block::

   $ sort -n lengths.txt

.. code-block::

     9  methane.pdb
    12  ethane.pdb
    15  propane.pdb
    20  cubane.pdb
    21  pentane.pdb
    30  octane.pdb
   107  total

We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called ``sorted-lengths.txt``
by putting ``sorted-lengths.txt`` after the command,
just as we used ``lengths.txt`` to put the output of ``wc`` into ``lengths.txt``.
Once we've done that,
we can run another command called ``head`` to get the first few lines in ``sorted-lengths.txt``\ :

.. code-block::

   $ sort -n lengths.txt sorted-lengths.txt
   $ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt

.. code-block::

     9  methane.pdb

Using ``-n 1`` with ``head`` tells it that
we only want the first line of the file;
``-n 20`` would get the first 20,
and so on.
Since ``sorted-lengths.txt`` contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,
the output of ``head`` must be the file with the fewest lines.

Redirecting to the same file
----------------------------

It's a very bad idea to try redirecting
the output of a command that operates on a file
to the same file. For example:

.. code-block::

   $ sort -n lengths.txt lengths.txt

Doing something like this may give you
incorrect results and/or delete
the contents of ``lengths.txt``.

What Does ``>>`` Mean?
--------------------------

We have seen the use of ``>``\ , but there is a similar operator ``>>`` which works slightly differently.
We'll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings.
We can use the ``echo`` command to print strings e.g.

.. code-block::

   $ echo The echo command prints text

.. code-block::

   The echo command prints text

Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:

.. code-block::

   $ echo hello testfile01.txt

and:

.. code-block::

   $ echo hello >testfile02.txt

Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 In the first example with ``>``\ , the string 'hello' is written to ``testfile01.txt``\ ,
 but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command.

 We see from the second example that the ``>>`` operator also writes 'hello' to a file
 (in this case\ ``testfile02.txt``\ ),
 but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e. when we run it for the second time).

Appending Data
--------------

We have already met the ``head`` command, which prints lines from the start of a file.
``tail`` is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.

Consider the file ``data-shell/data/animals.txt``.
After these commands, select the answer that
corresponds to the file ``animals-subset.txt``\ :

.. code-block::

   $ head -n 3 animals.txt animals-subset.txt
   $ tail -n 2 animals.txt >animals-subset.txt


#. The first three lines of ``animals.txt``
#. The last two lines of ``animals.txt``
#. The first three lines and the last two lines of ``animals.txt``
#. The second and third lines of ``animals.txt``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 Option 3 is correct.
 For option 1 to be correct we would only run the ``head`` command.
 For option 2 to be correct we would only run the ``tail`` command.
 For option 4 to be correct we would have to pipe the output of ``head`` into ``tail -n 2`` by doing ``head -n 3 animals.txt | tail -n 2 animals-subset.txt``

If you think this is confusing,
you're in good company:
even once you understand what ``wc``\ , ``sort``\ , and ``head`` do,
all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.
We can make it easier to understand by running ``sort`` and ``head`` together:

.. code-block::

   $ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1

.. code-block::

     9  methane.pdb

The vertical bar, ``|``\ , between the two commands is called a **pipe**.
It tells the shell that we want to use
the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.

Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.
That is, we can for example send the output of ``wc`` directly to ``sort``\ ,
and then the resulting output to ``head``.
Thus we first use a pipe to send the output of ``wc`` to ``sort``\ :

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n

.. code-block::

      9 methane.pdb
     12 ethane.pdb
     15 propane.pdb
     20 cubane.pdb
     21 pentane.pdb
     30 octane.pdb
    107 total

And now we send the output of this pipe, through another pipe, to ``head``\ , so that the full pipeline becomes:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1

.. code-block::

      9  methane.pdb

This is exactly like a mathematician nesting functions like *log(3x)*
and saying 'the log of three times *x*\ '.
In our case,
the calculation is 'head of sort of line count of ``*.pdb``\ '.

The redirection and pipes used in the last few commands are illustrated below:


.. image:: ../img/redirects-and-pipes.svg
   :target: ../img/redirects-and-pipes.svg
   :alt: Redirects and Pipes


Piping Commands Together
------------------------

In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of
lines. Which command listed below would work?


#. ``wc -l * sort -n head -n 3``
#. ``wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3``
#. ``wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n``
#. ``wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 Option 4 is the solution.
 The pipe character ``|`` is used to connect the output from one command to
 the input of another.
 ``>`` is used to redirect standard output to a file.
 Try it in the ``data-shell/molecules`` directory!

This idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful.
Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things,
Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well,
and that work well with each other.
This programming model is called 'pipes and filters'.
We've already seen pipes;
a **filter** is a program like ``wc`` or ``sort``
that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output.
Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way:
unless told to do otherwise,
they read from standard input,
do something with what they've read,
and write to standard output.

The key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input
and writes lines of text to standard output
can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well.
You can *and should* write your programs this way
so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.

Pipe Reading Comprehension
--------------------------

A file called ``animals.txt`` (in the ``data-shell/data`` folder) contains the following data:

.. code-block::

   2012-11-05,deer
   2012-11-05,rabbit
   2012-11-05,raccoon
   2012-11-06,rabbit
   2012-11-06,deer
   2012-11-06,fox
   2012-11-07,rabbit
   2012-11-07,bear

What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below?

.. code-block::

   $ cat animals.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r final.txt

Hint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The ``head`` command extracts the first 5 lines from ``animals.txt``.
 Then, the last 3 lines are extracted from the previous 5 by using the ``tail`` command.
 With the ``sort -r`` command those 3 lines are sorted in reverse order and finally,
 the output is redirected to a file ``final.txt``.
 The content of this file can be checked by executing ``cat final.txt``.
 The file should contain the following lines:

.. code-block::

    2012-11-06,rabbit
    2012-11-06,deer
    2012-11-05,raccoon

Pipe Construction
-----------------

For the file ``animals.txt`` from the previous exercise, consider the following command:

.. code-block::

   $ cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt

The ``cut`` command is used to remove or 'cut out' certain sections of each line in the file,
and ``cut`` expects the lines to be separated into columns by a :raw-html-m2r:`<kbd>`\ Tab</kbdcharacter.
A character used in this way is a called a **delimiter**.
In the example above we use the ``-d`` option to specify the comma as our delimiter character.
We have also used the ``-f`` option to specify that we want to extract the second field (column).
This gives the following output:

.. code-block::

   deer
   rabbit
   raccoon
   rabbit
   deer
   fox
   rabbit
   bear

The ``uniq`` command filters out adjacent matching lines in a file.
How could you extend this pipeline (using ``uniq`` and another command) to find
out what animals the file contains (without any duplicates in their
names)?

Solution
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    $ cut -d , -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq

Which Pipe?
-----------

The file ``animals.txt`` contains 8 lines of data formatted as follows:

.. code-block::

   2012-11-05,deer
   2012-11-05,rabbit
   2012-11-05,raccoon
   2012-11-06,rabbit
   ...

The ``uniq`` command has a ``-c`` option which gives a count of the
number of times a line occurs in its input.  Assuming your current
directory is ``data-shell/data/``\ , what command would you use to produce
a table that shows the total count of each type of animal in the file?


#. ``sort animals.txt | uniq -c``
#. ``sort -t, -k2,2 animals.txt | uniq -c``
#. ``cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | uniq -c``
#. ``cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c``
#. ``cut -d, -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 Option 4. is the correct answer.
 If you have difficulty understanding why, try running the commands, or sub-sections of
 the pipelines (make sure you are in the ``data-shell/data`` directory).

Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files
--------------------------------

Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
and created 17 files in the ``north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03`` directory described earlier.
As a quick check, starting from her home directory, Nelle types:

.. code-block::

   $ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
   $ wc -l *.txt

The output is 18 lines that look like this:

.. code-block::

   300 NENE01729A.txt
   300 NENE01729B.txt
   300 NENE01736A.txt
   300 NENE01751A.txt
   300 NENE01751B.txt
   300 NENE01812A.txt
   ... ...

Now she types this:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5

.. code-block::

    240 NENE02018B.txt
    300 NENE01729A.txt
    300 NENE01729B.txt
    300 NENE01736A.txt
    300 NENE01751A.txt

Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
When she goes back and checks it,
she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning --- someone
was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
and she forgot to reset it.
Before re-running that sample,
she checks to see if any files have too much data:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5

.. code-block::

    300 NENE02040B.txt
    300 NENE02040Z.txt
    300 NENE02043A.txt
    300 NENE02043B.txt
   5040 total

Those numbers look good --- but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?
All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';
by convention,
her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.
To find others like it, she does this:

.. code-block::

   $ ls *Z.txt

.. code-block::

   NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt

Sure enough,
when she checks the log on her laptop,
there's no depth recorded for either of those samples.
Since it's too late to get the information any other way,
she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
She could delete them using ``rm``\ ,
but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter,
so instead, she'll have to be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression ``*[AB].txt``.
As always,
the ``*`` matches any number of characters;
the expression ``[AB]`` matches either an 'A' or a 'B',
so this matches all the valid data files she has.

Wildcard Expressions
--------------------

Wildcard expressions can be very complex, but you can sometimes write
them in ways that only use simple syntax, at the expense of being a bit
more verbose.
Consider the directory ``data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03`` :
the wildcard expression ``*[AB].txt``
matches all files ending in ``A.txt`` or ``B.txt``. Imagine you forgot about
this.


#.
   Can you match the same set of files with basic wildcard expressions
   that do not use the ``[]`` syntax? *Hint*\ : You may need more than one
   command, or two arguments to the ``ls`` command.

#.
   If you used two commands, the files in your output will match the
   same set of files in this example. What is the small difference between the
   outputs?

#.
   If you used two commands, under what circumstances would your new
   expression produce an error message where the original one would not?

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#.
   A solution using two wildcard commands:

   .. code-block::

       $ ls *A.txt
       $ ls *B.txt

    A solution using one command but with two arguments:

   .. code-block::

       $ ls *A.txt *B.txt

#.
   The output from the two new commands is separated because there are two commands.

#. When there are no files ending in ``A.txt``\ , or there are no files ending in
   ``B.txt``\ , then one of the two commands will fail.

Removing Unneeded Files
-----------------------

Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep
your raw files and processing script to save storage.
The raw files end in ``.dat`` and the processed files end in ``.txt``.
Which of the following would remove all the processed data files,
and *only* the processed data files?


#. ``rm ?.txt``
#. ``rm *.txt``
#. ``rm * .txt``
#. ``rm *.*``

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#. This would remove ``.txt`` files with one-character names
#. This is correct answer
#. The shell would expand ``*`` to match everything in the current directory,
   so the command would try to remove all matched files and an additional
   file called ``.txt``
#. The shell would expand ``*.*`` to match all files with any extension,
   so this command would delete all files

Finding Things


**Questions:**
* How can I find files?
* How can I find things in files?

**Objectives:**

* "Use ``grep`` to select lines from text files that match simple patterns."
* "Use ``find`` to find files and directories whose names match simple patterns."
* "Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command."
* "Explain what is meant by 'text' and 'binary' files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well."

**Keypoints:**

* "\ ``find`` finds files with specific properties that match patterns."
* "\ ``grep`` selects lines in files that match patterns."
* "\ ``--help`` is an option supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within Bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs."
* "\ ``man [command]`` displays the manual page for a given command."
* "\ ``$([command])`` inserts a command's output in place."

----

In the same way that many of us now use 'Google' as a
verb meaning 'to find', Unix programmers often use the
word 'grep'.
'grep' is a contraction of 'global/regular expression/print',
a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.
It is also the name of a very useful command-line program.

``grep`` finds and prints lines in files that match a pattern.
For our examples,
we will use a file that contains three haikus taken from a
1998 competition in *Salon* magazine. For this set of examples,
we're going to be working in the writing subdirectory:

.. code-block::

   $ cd
   $ cd Desktop/data-shell/writing
   $ cat haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   The Tao that is seen
   Is not the true Tao, until
   You bring fresh toner.

   With searching comes loss
   and the presence of absence:
   "My Thesis" not found.

   Yesterday it worked
   Today it is not working
   Software is like that.

Forever, or Five Years
----------------------

We haven't linked to the original haikus because they don't appear to be on *Salon*\ 's site any longer.
As `Jeff Rothenberg said <https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/ensuring.pdf>`_\ ,
'Digital information lasts forever --- or five years, whichever comes first.'
Luckily, popular content often `has backups <http://wiki.c2.com/?ComputerErrorHaiku>`_.

Let's find lines that contain the word 'not':

.. code-block::

   $ grep not haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   Is not the true Tao, until
   "My Thesis" not found
   Today it is not working

Here, ``not`` is the pattern we're searching for. The grep command searches through the file, looking for matches to the pattern specified. To use it type ``grep``\ , then the pattern we're searching for and finally the name of the file (or files) we're searching in.

The output is the three lines in the file that contain the letters 'not'.

By default, grep searches for a pattern in a case-sensitive way. In addition, the search pattern we have selected does not have to form a complete word, as we will see in the next example.

Let's search for the pattern: 'The'.

.. code-block::

   $ grep The haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   The Tao that is seen
   "My Thesis" not found.

This time, two lines that include the letters 'The' are outputted,
one of which contained our search pattern within a larger word, 'Thesis'.

To restrict matches to lines containing the word 'The' on its own,
we can give ``grep`` with the ``-w`` option.
This will limit matches to word boundaries.

Later in this lesson, we will also see how we can change the search behavior of grep with respect to its case sensitivity.

.. code-block::

   $ grep -w The haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   The Tao that is seen

Note that a 'word boundary' includes the start and end of a line, so not
just letters surrounded by spaces.
Sometimes we don't
want to search for a single word, but a phrase. This is also easy to do with
``grep`` by putting the phrase in quotes.

.. code-block::

   $ grep -w "is not" haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   Today it is not working

We've now seen that you don't have to have quotes around single words,
but it is useful to use quotes when searching for multiple words.
It also helps to make it easier to distinguish between the search term or phrase
and the file being searched.
We will use quotes in the remaining examples.

Another useful option is ``-n``\ , which numbers the lines that match:

.. code-block::

   $ grep -n "it" haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   5:With searching comes loss
   9:Yesterday it worked
   10:Today it is not working

Here, we can see that lines 5, 9, and 10 contain the letters 'it'.

We can combine options (i.e. flags) as we do with other Unix commands.
For example, let's find the lines that contain the word 'the'. We can combine
the option ``-w`` to find the lines that contain the word 'the' and ``-n`` to number the lines that match:

.. code-block::

   $ grep -n -w "the" haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   2:Is not the true Tao, until
   6:and the presence of absence:

Now we want to use the option ``-i`` to make our search case-insensitive:

.. code-block::

   $ grep -n -w -i "the" haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   1:The Tao that is seen
   2:Is not the true Tao, until
   6:and the presence of absence:

Now, we want to use the option ``-v`` to invert our search, i.e., we want to output
the lines that do not contain the word 'the'.

.. code-block::

   $ grep -n -w -v "the" haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   1:The Tao that is seen
   3:You bring fresh toner.
   4:
   5:With searching comes loss
   7:"My Thesis" not found.
   8:
   9:Yesterday it worked
   10:Today it is not working
   11:Software is like that.

If we use the ``-r`` (recursive) option,
``grep`` can search for a pattern recursively through a set of files in subdirectories.

Let's search recursively for ``Yesterday`` in the ``data-shell/writing`` directory:

.. code-block::

   grep -r Yesterday .

.. code-block::

   data/LittleWomen.txt:"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a
   data/LittleWomen.txt:Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then
   data/LittleWomen.txt:Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my
   haiku.txt:Yesterday it worked

``grep`` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

.. code-block::

   $ grep --help

.. code-block::

   Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
   Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.
   PATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).
   Example: grep -i 'hello world' menu.h main.c

   Regexp selection and interpretation:
     -E, --extended-regexp     PATTERN is an extended regular expression (ERE)
     -F, --fixed-strings       PATTERN is a set of newline-separated fixed strings
     -G, --basic-regexp        PATTERN is a basic regular expression (BRE)
     -P, --perl-regexp         PATTERN is a Perl regular expression
     -e, --regexp=PATTERN      use PATTERN for matching
     -f, --file=FILE           obtain PATTERN from FILE
     -i, --ignore-case         ignore case distinctions
     -w, --word-regexp         force PATTERN to match only whole words
     -x, --line-regexp         force PATTERN to match only whole lines
     -z, --null-data           a data line ends in 0 byte, not newline

   Miscellaneous:
   ...        ...        ...

Using ``grep``
------------------

Which command would result in the following output:

.. code-block::

   and the presence of absence:


#. ``grep "of" haiku.txt``
#. ``grep -E "of" haiku.txt``
#. ``grep -w "of" haiku.txt``
#. ``grep -i "of" haiku.txt``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The correct answer is 3, because the ``-w`` option looks only for whole-word matches.
 The other options will also match 'of' when part of another word.

Wildcards
---------

``grep``\ 's real power doesn't come from its options, though; it comes from
the fact that patterns can include wildcards. (The technical name for
these is **regular expressions**\ , which
is what the 're' in 'grep' stands for.) Regular expressions are both complex
and powerful; if you want to do complex searches, please look at the lesson
on `our website <http://v4.software-carpentry.org/regexp/index.html>`_. As a taster, we can
find lines that have an 'o' in the second position like this:

.. code-block::

   $ grep -E "^.o" haiku.txt

.. code-block::

   You bring fresh toner.
   Today it is not working
   Software is like that.

We use the ``-E`` option and put the pattern in quotes to prevent the shell
from trying to interpret it. (If the pattern contained a ``*``\ , for
example, the shell would try to expand it before running ``grep``.) The
``^`` in the pattern anchors the match to the start of the line. The ``.``
matches a single character (just like ``?`` in the shell), while the ``o``
matches an actual 'o'.

Tracking a Species
------------------

Leah has several hundred
data files saved in one directory, each of which is formatted like this:

.. code-block::

   2013-11-05,deer,5
   2013-11-05,rabbit,22
   2013-11-05,raccoon,7
   2013-11-06,rabbit,19
   2013-11-06,deer,2

She wants to write a shell script that takes a species as the first command-line argument
and a directory as the second argument. The script should return one file called ``species.txt``
containing a list of dates and the number of that species seen on each date.
For example using the data shown above, ``rabbit.txt`` would contain:

.. code-block::

   2013-11-05,22
   2013-11-06,19

Put these commands and pipes in the right order to achieve this:

.. code-block::

   cut -d : -f 2

   |
   grep -w $1 -r $2
   |
   $1.txt
   cut -d , -f 1,3

Hint: use ``man grep`` to look for how to grep text recursively in a directory
and ``man cut`` to select more than one field in a line.

An example of such a file is provided in ``data-shell/data/animal-counts/animals.txt``

Solution
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    grep -w $1 -r $2 | cut -d : -f 2 | cut -d , -f 1,3  $1.txt

 You would call the script above like this:

.. code-block::

    $ bash count-species.sh bear .

Little Women
------------

You and your friend, having just finished reading *Little Women* by
Louisa May Alcott, are in an argument.  Of the four sisters in the
book, Jo, Meg, Beth, and Amy, your friend thinks that Jo was the
most mentioned.  You, however, are certain it was Amy.  Luckily, you
have a file ``LittleWomen.txt`` containing the full text of the novel
(\ ``data-shell/writing/data/LittleWomen.txt``\ ).
Using a ``for`` loop, how would you tabulate the number of times each
of the four sisters is mentioned?

Hint: one solution might employ
the commands ``grep`` and ``wc`` and a ``|``\ , while another might utilize
``grep`` options.
There is often more than one way to solve a programming task, so a
particular solution is usually chosen based on a combination of
yielding the correct result, elegance, readability, and speed.

Solutions
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::

    for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy
    do
       echo $sis:
       grep -ow $sis LittleWomen.txt | wc -l
    done

 Alternative, slightly inferior solution:

.. code-block::

    for sis in Jo Meg Beth Amy
    do
       echo $sis:
       grep -ocw $sis LittleWomen.txt
    done

 This solution is inferior because ``grep -c`` only reports the number of lines matched.
 The total number of matches reported by this method will be lower if there is more
 than one match per line.

 Perceptive observers may have noticed that character names sometimes appear in all-uppercase
 in chapter titles (e.g. 'MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR').
 If you wanted to count these as well, you could add the ``-i`` option for case-insensitivity
 (though in this case, it doesn't affect the answer to which sister is mentioned most frequently).

While ``grep`` finds lines in files,
the ``find`` command finds files themselves.
Again,
it has a lot of options;
to show how the simplest ones work, we'll use the directory tree shown below.


.. image:: ../img/find-file-tree.svg
   :target: ../img/find-file-tree.svg
   :alt: File Tree for Find Example


Nelle's ``writing`` directory contains one file called ``haiku.txt`` and three subdirectories:
``thesis`` (which contains a sadly empty file, ``empty-draft.md``\ );
``data`` (which contains three files ``LittleWomen.txt``\ , ``one.txt`` and ``two.txt``\ );
and a ``tools`` directory that contains the programs ``format`` and ``stats``\ ,
and a subdirectory called ``old``\ , with a file ``oldtool``.

For our first command,
let's run ``find .`` (remember to run this command from the ``data-shell/writing`` folder).

.. code-block::

   $ find .

.. code-block::

   .
   ./data
   ./data/one.txt
   ./data/LittleWomen.txt
   ./data/two.txt
   ./tools
   ./tools/format
   ./tools/old
   ./tools/old/oldtool
   ./tools/stats
   ./haiku.txt
   ./thesis
   ./thesis/empty-draft.md

As always,
the ``.`` on its own means the current working directory,
which is where we want our search to start.
``find``\ 's output is the names of every file **and** directory
under the current working directory.
This can seem useless at first but ``find`` has many options
to filter the output and in this lesson we will discover some
of them.

The first option in our list is
``-type d`` that means 'things that are directories'.
Sure enough,
``find``\ 's output is the names of the five directories in our little tree
(including ``.``\ ):

.. code-block::

   $ find . -type d

.. code-block::

   ./
   ./data
   ./thesis
   ./tools
   ./tools/old

Notice that the objects ``find`` finds are not listed in any particular order.
If we change ``-type d`` to ``-type f``\ ,
we get a listing of all the files instead:

.. code-block::

   $ find . -type f

.. code-block::

   ./haiku.txt
   ./tools/stats
   ./tools/old/oldtool
   ./tools/format
   ./thesis/empty-draft.md
   ./data/one.txt
   ./data/LittleWomen.txt
   ./data/two.txt

Now let's try matching by name:

.. code-block::

   $ find . -name *.txt

.. code-block::

   ./haiku.txt

We expected it to find all the text files,
but it only prints out ``./haiku.txt``.
The problem is that the shell expands wildcard characters like ``*`` *before* commands run.
Since ``*.txt`` in the current directory expands to ``haiku.txt``\ ,
the command we actually ran was:

.. code-block::

   $ find . -name haiku.txt

``find`` did what we asked; we just asked for the wrong thing.

To get what we want,
let's do what we did with ``grep``\ :
put ``*.txt`` in quotes to prevent the shell from expanding the ``*`` wildcard.
This way,
``find`` actually gets the pattern ``*.txt``\ , not the expanded filename ``haiku.txt``\ :

.. code-block::

   $ find . -name "*.txt"

.. code-block::

   ./data/one.txt
   ./data/LittleWomen.txt
   ./data/two.txt
   ./haiku.txt

Listing vs. Finding
-------------------

``ls`` and ``find`` can be made to do similar things given the right options,
but under normal circumstances,
``ls`` lists everything it can,
while ``find`` searches for things with certain properties and shows them.

As we said earlier,
the command line's power lies in combining tools.
We've seen how to do that with pipes;
let's look at another technique.
As we just saw,
``find . -name "*.txt"`` gives us a list of all text files in or below the current directory.
How can we combine that with ``wc -l`` to count the lines in all those files?

The simplest way is to put the ``find`` command inside ``$()``\ :

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l $(find . -name "*.txt")

.. code-block::

   11 ./haiku.txt
   300 ./data/two.txt
   21022 ./data/LittleWomen.txt
   70 ./data/one.txt
   21403 total

When the shell executes this command,
the first thing it does is run whatever is inside the ``$()``.
It then replaces the ``$()`` expression with that command's output.
Since the output of ``find`` is the four filenames ``./data/one.txt``\ , ``./data/LittleWomen.txt``\ , ``./data/two.txt``\ , and ``./haiku.txt``\ ,
the shell constructs the command:

.. code-block::

   $ wc -l ./data/one.txt ./data/LittleWomen.txt ./data/two.txt ./haiku.txt

which is what we wanted.
This expansion is exactly what the shell does when it expands wildcards like ``*`` and ``?``\ ,
but lets us use any command we want as our own 'wildcard'.

It's very common to use ``find`` and ``grep`` together.
The first finds files that match a pattern;
the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
Here, for example, we can find PDB files that contain iron atoms
by looking for the string 'FE' in all the ``.pdb`` files above the current directory:

.. code-block::

   $ grep "FE" $(find .. -name "*.pdb")

.. code-block::

   ../data/pdb/heme.pdb:ATOM     25 FE           1      -0.924   0.535  -0.518

Matching and Subtracting
------------------------

The ``-v`` option to ``grep`` inverts pattern matching, so that only lines
which do *not* match the pattern are printed. Given that, which of
the following commands will find all files in ``/data`` whose names
end in ``s.txt`` but whose names also do *not* contain the string ``net``\ ?
(For example, ``animals.txt`` or ``amino-acids.txt`` but not ``planets.txt``.)
Once you have thought about your answer, you can test the commands in the ``data-shell``
directory.


#. ``find data -name "*s.txt" | grep -v net``
#. ``find data -name *s.txt | grep -v net``
#. ``grep -v "net" $(find data -name "*s.txt")``
#. None of the above.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

 The correct answer is 1. Putting the match expression in quotes prevents the shell
 expanding it, so it gets passed to the ``find`` command.

 Option 2 is incorrect because the shell expands ``*s.txt`` instead of passing the wildcard
 expression to ``find``.

 Option 3 is incorrect because it searches the contents of the files for lines which
 do not match 'net', rather than searching the file names.

Binary Files
------------

We have focused exclusively on finding patterns in text files. What if
your data is stored as images, in databases, or in some other format?

A handful of tools extend ``grep`` to handle a few non text formats. But a
more generalizable approach is to convert the data to text, or
extract the text-like elements from the data. On the one hand, it makes simple
things easy to do. On the other hand, complex things are usually impossible. For
example, it's easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y
dimensions from image files for ``grep`` to play with, but how would you
write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained
formulas?

A last option is to recognize that the shell and text processing have
their limits, and to use another programming language.
When the time comes to do this, don't be too hard on the shell: many
modern programming languages have borrowed a lot of
ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise.

The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it. It has
survived so long because it is one of the most productive programming
environments ever created --- maybe even *the* most productive. Its syntax
may be cryptic, but people who have mastered it can experiment with
different commands interactively, then use what they have learned to
automate their work. Graphical user interfaces may be better at the
first, but the shell is still unbeaten at the second. And as Alfred
North Whitehead wrote in 1911, 'Civilization advances by extending the
number of important operations which we can perform without thinking
about them.'

``find`` Pipeline Reading Comprehension
-------------------------------------------

Write a short explanatory comment for the following shell script:

.. code-block::

   wc -l $(find . -name "*.dat") | sort -n

Solution
~~~~~~~~


#. Find all files with a ``.dat`` extension recursively from the current directory
#. Count the number of lines each of these files contains
#. Sort the output from step 2. numerically
